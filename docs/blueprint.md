## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Desaturated silver (#C0C0C0). A subdued, but professional-looking color for calls to action, interactive elements and highlights.
- Background color: Matte black (#121212). The brand namesake forms a natural, sleek background to present the supplement products against.
- Accent color: Off-white (#F0F0F0). Provides a smooth contrast, while remaining in-step with the desaturated palette. Reserved for key informational elements and textual content.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif). With the sparseness of the content on most pages, 'Belleza' can also be used in smaller headings or sub-headings.
- Body font: 'Alegreya' (serif) This typeface is well-suited for small to medium amounts of text, such as product descriptions or information about the company.
- Clean, minimalist design. Plenty of whitespace to create a sense of high-end quality. Product photography should be central, drawing the userâ€™s eye.
- Sleek and elegant animations for scrolling and click events to enhance the user experience. Animations should be subtle and not distracting.
